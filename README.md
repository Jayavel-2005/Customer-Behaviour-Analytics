🔍 Key Insights
1️⃣ Gender-Based Revenue
  Revenue distribution varies between male and female customers, giving insight into gender-specific purchasing trends.
2️⃣ Discounts Lead to Higher Spend
  Customers who used discounts often spent more than the average purchase amount, indicating strong price sensitivity.
3️⃣ Top-Rated Products Identified
  The top 5 products with the highest review ratings help identify quality-driven customer preferences.
4️⃣ Shipping Type Affects Spending
  Average purchase amount changes significantly between Standard and Express shipping types.
5️⃣ Subscription Users Spend More
  Subscribed customers show higher average spending and generate more revenue overall.
6️⃣ Discount Usage Patterns
  Certain products have exceptionally high discount usage, indicating opportunities for strategic promotions.
7️⃣ Customer Segmentation
  Customers were segmented into:
    New (1 previous purchase)
    Returning (2–10 purchases)
    Loyal (10+)
  This helps in targeted marketing campaigns.
8️⃣ Category Leaders
  Top 3 most-purchased items in every category were identified, aiding inventory planning.
9️⃣ Repeat Buyer Behavior
  Customers with more than 5 purchases show clear patterns in subscription usage.
🔟 Revenue by Age Group
  Young Adults drive the highest revenue, whereas Seniors contribute the least, guiding demographic-specific marketing.

💡 Business Recommendations
1. Increase Subscription Conversions
  Offer free trials, rewards, and exclusive discounts to convert non-subscribers.
2. Promote High-Performing Categories
  Clothing and accessories should be prioritized during sales and campaigns.
3. Boost Low-Performing Categories (e.g., Outerwear)
  Use seasonal discounts and homepage promotion to increase visibility.
4. Use Customer Segmentation for Targeted Ads
  Send tailored campaigns to New, Returning, and Loyal customers.
5. Shipping Strategy Optimization
  Introduce incentives for Standard shipping or free shipping thresholds.
6. Promote Top-Rated Products
  Use these as hero products in ads, recommendations, and homepage banners.
7. Target Young Adults
  This segment has the highest revenue contribution → focus digital marketing on them.
